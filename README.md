# Single_phase_Halfwave_uncontrolled_rectifier
A half-wave rectifier is a circuit that allows only one half of an AC waveform to pass through to the load, blocking the other half. It uses a single diode in series with the load to achieve this.  This is called uncontrolled because it uses a diode (not a thyristor), and therefore no external control signal is required.
